=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sub::Become;
    
    sub foo {
        my $t = Date->new();
        become {
            return $t;
        }
        return foo();
    }
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

A useful technique in languages like JavaScript is to write a function
that replaces its own definition:

    var foo = function() {
        var t = new Date();
        foo = function() {
            return t;
        };
        return foo();
    };

See L<http://peter.michaux.ca/article/3556> for a complete explanation
of the technique.

C<Sub::Become> provides a little syntactic sugar to make this
easy in Perl too. See the SYNOPSIS for an example.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 C<< become >>

Replace the current subroutine with the supplied code block:

    sub bar {
        become { 2 }; # return 2 next time
        return 1;     # return 1 first time
    }

If you need to return the value that the new subroutine definition would
have returned in the same invocation either have the subroutine recurse:

    sub expensive {
        my $thing = some_expensive_calculation();
        become { $thing };
        return expensive();
    }

Or exploit the fact that C<become> returns the code reference for the
new definition:

    sub expensive {
        my $thing = some_expensive_calculation();
        return (become { $thing })->();
    }

=cut

sub become(&) {
    croak "become needs a coderef"
      unless @_ == 1 && 'CODE' eq ref $_[0];
    no strict 'refs';
    no warnings 'redefine';
    return *{ ( caller 1 )[3] } = shift;
}
